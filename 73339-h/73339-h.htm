<h1>WHAT BOOKS TO LEND<br>
<span class="smaller"><span class="smaller">AND</span><br>
WHAT TO GIVE.</span></h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

</div>

<p>Wholesome and amusing literature has become almost a
necessity among the appliances of parish work. The power
of reading leads, in most cases, to the craving for books.
If good be not provided, evil will be only too easily found,
and it is absolutely necessary to raise the taste so as to lead
to a voluntary avoidance of the profane and disgusting.</p>

<p>Books of a superior class are the only means of such
cultivation. It has been found that where really able and
interesting literature is to be had, there is much less disposition
to prey upon garbage. And the school lessons
on English have this effect, that they make book-language
comprehensible far more widely than has hitherto been the
case.</p>

<p>A library is an almost indispensable adjunct to a school,
if the children are to be lured to stay at home instead of
playing questionable games in the dark, or by gaslight, out
of doors; and an amusing story is the best chance of their not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
exasperating the weary father with noise. If the boy is not
to betake himself to ‘Jack Sheppard’ literature, he must be
beguiled by wholesome adventure. If the girl is not to
study the ‘penny dreadful,’ her notions must be refined by
the tale of high romance or pure pathos.</p>

<p>The children at school are often eager readers, especially
if they have sensible parents who forbid roaming about in
the evening. There ought always to be a school library
unless the children are provided for in the general parish
library; but even this requires careful selection. Weak,
dull, or unnatural books may be absolutely harmful when
falling into rude or scornful hands. For instance, a country
lad should not have a book where a farmer gives a prize for
climbing an elm-tree to take a blackbird’s nest, such a proceeding
being equally against the nature of farmers, blackbirds,
and elms. Seafaring lads should not have incorrectly
worded accounts of wrecks; and where more serious matters
come in, there should be still greater care to be strong, true,
and real. Boys especially should not have childish tales with
weak morality or ‘washy’ piety; but should have heroism and
nobleness kept before their eyes; and learn to despise all
that is untruthful or cowardly and to respect womanhood.
True manhood needs, above all earthly qualities, to be impressed
on them, and books of example (not precept) with
heroes, whose sentiments they admire, may always raise their
tone, sometimes individually, sometimes collectively.</p>

<p>Men, however, must have manly books. Real solid
literature alone will arrest their attention. They grudge
the trouble of reading what they do not accept as truth,
unless it is some book whose fame has reached their ears,
and to have read which they regard as an achievement.</p>

<p>Where grown men are subscribers to a library, it should
have standard works of well-known reputation.</p>

<p>Travels, biographies, not too long, poetry, histories of
contemporaneous events, and fiction of the kind that may
be called classical, should be the staple for them. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
hardly advisable to attempt to give a list for them. Their
books belong to general literature, with which I do not wish
to meddle, and besides, reading men mostly inhabit towns
where there are generally Institutes from which they can obtain
books. In the country, when the clever cobbler or gardener
soars above the village library, he will generally have a decided
notion of what he wants, and will respect a special loan
from our own shelves. He may take to some line in
natural science, or have some personal cause for interest in
a colony; but in general, the labourer would rather smoke than
read in his hours of rest, and even when laid aside in a
hospital, newspaper scraps pasted into a book are often
more welcome to him than more continuous subjects.
Above all, he resents being <i>written down to</i> or laughed at;
and calling him Hodge and Chawbacon is the sure way to
alienate him.</p>

<p>Books with strong imitations of dialect are to be avoided.
They are almost unintelligible to those who know the look
of a word in its right spelling, though they might miscall
it, and do not recognise it when phonetically travestied to
imitate a local dialect, as for instance by <i>ah</i> for <i>I</i>. Moreover,
they feel it a caricature of their language, and are very
reasonably insulted. They do not appreciate simplicity, but
are in the stage of civilisation when long words are rather
preferred, partly as a compliment, partly as a new language.
Complicated phrases are often too much for them, but polysyllables
need not be avoided, if such are really needed to
express an idea, and will do it better than any shorter word.</p>

<p>Though men either read with strong appetites or not at
all, their wives, in these days of education, generally love
fiction. They do not want to be improved, but they like to
lose their cares for a little while in some tale that excites
either tears or laughter. It is all very well to say that they
ought to have no time for reading. An industrious thrifty
woman has little or none, but the cottager’s wife who does
as little needlework, washing, or tidying as possible, has a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
good many hours to spend in gossip or in reading. She
may get cheap sensational novels, and the effects on a weak
and narrow mind are often very serious. The only thing to
be done is to take care that she has access to a full supply
of what can do her no harm, and may by reiteration do her
good, though the links between book and action are in many
cases never joined. Sometimes they are not connected at
all, sometimes a strong impression is unexpectedly made.
But this class of women must have incident, pathos, and
sentiment to attract them. The old-fashioned book where
Betty rebukes Polly in set language for wearing a red cloak
instead of a grey one, and eating new bread instead of old,
will meet with no attention. But if the moral of the tale
be sound, and the tone of the characters who bespeak
sympathy, high, pure, and good, the standard of the reader,
however frivolous, must be insensibly raised. At any rate,
by withholding books because the cottage woman ought to
be too busy to want them, we do not render her more
industrious, but we leave her exposed to catering for herself
in undesirable regions.</p>

<p>There remain the thrifty, sensible, good women who, if
they read at all, do so in their Sunday leisure, and like a
serious book. Neither variety of woman likes a book manifestly
for children lent to themselves, though they do enjoy
anything about a baby from the maternal point of view.</p>

<p>There are such different degrees of intelligence and
civilisation among the women who frequent mothers’ meetings
that it is difficult to make suggestions applying to all.
Some of these meetings are attended so irregularly that it is
not possible to read anything continuous, whereas in others
a sustained interest promotes regularity. A little religious
instruction or exhortation, a little domestic or sanitary instruction,
and a lively or pathetic narrative seem to answer best, and
I have endeavoured to collect the titles of books useful in
this respect. The two first, however, are best given extempore
if a clergyman will come for the first, and a lady who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
has attended ambulance classes can be secured for the
second.</p>

<p>The lad or young man species comes next. There are
a few of these with a thirst for information, and it is important
to supply this in a sound and wholesome form. Some
like poetry, but the general run can only be induced to read
at all by adventurous or humorous tales.</p>

<p>Those who act as Sunday school teachers may, however,
be led to study books bearing on the subjects they have to
teach, or to get up for certificates, and thus may be brought
to take an interest in religious literature, which may deepen
as they grow older.</p>

<p>There is always, too, a certain proportion who have a
strong turn for fact, and like to have solid truth before
them. Of course all these can read the same books as the
elder men, and even more difficult ones, as their education
has gone farther; but they need more that is light, easy, and
inviting, and a lending-library or reading-room requires a
supply fitted for both.</p>

<p>It is a pity there is not more good biography suited for
this purpose. The popularity of Miss Marsh’s ‘Hedley
Vicars’ showed what a book written without too much detail
and with general interest might be. Some of Smiles’s
biographies come near the mark, also some American ones,
and those shilling books of Cassell’s called ‘The World’s
Workers,’ also some published by Nelson and by Blackie.</p>

<p>Good books of travels, too, are increasing favourites;
also such books as ‘Her Majesty’s Mail,’ and ‘Engine-Driving
Life.’ In fact, whatever <i>wholesomely</i> interests our
own households may well be sent into the club-room,
provided it do not presuppose too much culture. Many of
these books may be bought second-hand at a cheap rate from
the Libraries. And there should be a good stock of standard
fiction: Scott, Dickens, Fenimore Cooper, are all to be had
at almost any price, and would pretty well supply in themselves
the requirements of reading-room fiction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>The corresponding class of girls and young women are
for the most part indiscriminate devourers of fiction, and,
like the women before mentioned, need to have their
appetite rightly directed. But there is more hope of them
than of their elders, and their ideal is capable of being
raised by high-minded tales, which may refine their notions.
The semi-religious novel or novelette is to them moralising
put into action, and the most likely way of reaching
them.</p>

<p>We must not be too hasty to condemn their frivolous
tastes. Whether in business or in service, they are tired,
the book is recreation, and they cannot be expected to want
to improve themselves when their brains and bodies are
alike weary. Still we can supply them with books that will
not give them false views of life, and that will foster
enthusiasm for courage and truth, make vulgarity disgusting,
and show religion as the only true spring of life. Through
classes for Sunday teachers, and Communicants’ or Bible
classes, some spirit of religious study may be infused.</p>

<p>As to secular self-improvement, the students will always
be few and far between, and the experience of most libraries
is that there is little or no demand for improving books. So
much is <i>taught</i> that there is little inclination to learn. A
reaction sometimes comes to men, but seldom to women,
whose home industries and occupations necessarily absorb
them so that their reading must be either devotional
or recreative.</p>

<p>Thus there is very little call for improving books in the
lending library, in proportion to those meant for recreation;
but I would urge that they should be used for prizes.
At present, the usual habit is to choose gay outsides and
pretty pictures, with little heed to the contents, but it should
be remembered that the lent book is ephemeral, read in a
week and passed on, while the prize remains, is exhibited
to relatives and friends, is read over and over, becomes a
resource in illness, and forms part of the possessions to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
handed on to the next generation. Therefore, after the
infant period, the reward book should generally be of some
worthiness, either religious, improving, or at least standard
fiction. Weakness and poverty of thought should be avoided,
especially as these books may fall into the hands of clever,
ungodly men, and serve to excite their mockery. It should
be remembered that the child to whom the book is given
will not always remain a child, and therefore that it is better
to let the new and cherished possession go beyond its present
level of taste or capacity.</p>

<p>The elder lad, whose schooldays are over, sometimes
begins to waken to intelligence, and to be ready to seek information,
in some cases being glad of really deep reading on
scientific, political, or theological subjects, and it is all-important
to preoccupy his mind with sound views before he
meets with specious trash. Many indeed both of lads and
men are absorbed in actual practical life and never read at
all, or nothing but newspapers. Yet even these when laid
low by illness will accept a book to pass away the weary
hours.</p>

<p>Nothing, of course, can equal the effect of personal influence,
from schoolmaster, clergyman, or lady, but each
of these may find books, lent, recommended, or read aloud,
of great assistance.</p>

<p>Some books of advice deprecate reading aloud in Sunday
schools. My own experience, now of many years, is
that it is of great assistance in impressing the scholars, and
gives great pleasure. I have been told of my old pupils
mentioning it as one of the enjoyments of their younger
days; and when a part of a story has been missed by
absence, the connection is eagerly supplied by the listeners
who have been present. Moreover, those books in the
lending library are always most sought after which have
been read aloud, and sometimes elucidated, either at the
Sunday school or at the mothers’ meeting.</p>

<p>But books for this purpose must be carefully selected,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
with a view to the capacities and tastes of the listeners, and
be read really well and dramatically, watching the eyes of
the hearers—a rapid or monotonous utterance is almost
useless, and inattention leads to bad habits.</p>

<p>There is no reason against giving tales about persons in
different stations of life from that of those who receive them,
and in fact they are often preferred; but it is as well to avoid
those that deal with temptations or enjoyments out of reach of
the school-child; or which dwell on beauty, finery, dainties,
or any variety of pomps or vanities as delights of wealth or
rank. The enjoyment that authors have in describing a lovely,
beautifully-dressed child in a charming attitude should be
sacrificed in writing for children of any rank, unless they
are to learn vanity and affectation, or else be set to covet
such pleasures.</p>

<p>It is curious to find how many stories have become
obsolete. Not only have the tales where vanity is displayed
by wearing white stockings and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A bonnet cocked up to display to the view</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long ringlets of curls and a great bow of blue,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">become archaic; but the stories of the good children
who are household supports and little nurses, picking up
chance crumbs of instruction, have lost all present reality
such as the younger and less clever children require.</p>

<p>Elder ones, if they have any imagination, prefer what
does not run in the grooves of their daily life, and some are
much more willing to listen to, or to read, what is not too
obviously written for them. A book labelled ‘A tale for—’
is apt to carry a note of warning to the perverse spirits of
those to whom it is addressed.</p>

<p>Historical tales and those of other lands require a certain
degree of cultivation and imagination, to be appreciated.
To some, even the best are distasteful, to others they supply
the element of romance. Those that have a charm about
them of character and adventure, fitting them for almost all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
readers, have been put into the groups intended for the age
they suit, as well as into their places as illustrations of
history.</p>

<p>I endeavour to give here a classified list that may be an
assistance in the choice of books. It is <i>not</i> an advertisement.
Most of the books I have personally proved. No
doubt many readers will be disappointed at omissions, but
it is quite impossible to answer for all the books in existence,
and my object here is to suggest the fittest for the purposes
of lending, reading aloud, or giving. It is no condemnation
of a work that its name does not appear in this list—only
it has either not become known to me, or has not appeared
to me so eminently desirable as the others.</p>

<p>The lists of books in the present work have been drawn
up in different gradations, a great number of them having
been actually proved by reading aloud. There are many
very fairly suitable for <i>lending</i>, not equally good for reading
aloud, as lengthiness, description, and over-moralising,
hang on hand with a mixed class; and, in other cases,
the reader seems to be inculcating with authority all that
is uttered, and thus gives a sense of preaching instead of
amusing.</p>

<p>The tales that have any dissenting bias, or which appear
to involve false doctrine, are of course omitted, though all
those here mentioned do not belong to the same school of
thought within the Church.</p>

<p>The classified list then includes books for:—</p>

<p><i>Little Ones.</i>—Fit to be read or given to children from
four to eight.</p>

<p><i>Junior Classes.</i>—Children from seven or eight to ten or
eleven.</p>

<p><i>Senior Classes.</i>—From ten upwards.</p>

<p><i>Boys.</i>—The books may be read by girls also, but most
boys will not read girls’ books, therefore their literature is
put separately.</p>

<p><i>Drawing Room Stories.</i>—The best are mentioned here,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
but all, though excellent, are, on experience, out of the ken
of the school child.</p>

<p><i>On the Catechism.</i></p>

<p><i>On Confirmation.</i></p>

<p><i>On the Prayer Book.</i></p>

<p><i>On the Bible.</i></p>

<p><i>Allegories.</i></p>

<p>Stories on Church History.</p>

<p><span class="ditto">”</span> English History.</p>

<p><span class="ditto">”</span> General History.</p>

<p><i>Mythological Tales.</i></p>

<p><i>Novelettes.</i></p>

<p><i>Fairy Tales.</i></p>

<p><i>Mothers’ Meetings.</i></p>

<p><i>Mission Working Parties.</i></p>

<p><i>Descriptions of Countries.</i></p>

<p><i>Adventures.</i></p>

<p><i>Biography.</i></p>

<p><i>History.</i></p>

<p><i>Church History.</i></p>

<p><i>Natural History and Popular Science.</i></p>

<p><i>Religious Books.</i></p>

<p><i>Magazines.</i></p>

<p><i>Penny Readings.</i></p>

<p>It should be clearly understood that nobody is urged to
have anything like all the books here mentioned, but that
the object is to answer the oft-recurring question—Where
shall I find a book suited for such and such a purpose?</p>

<p>I have added a few suggestions of extracts for penny
readings, but it is not easy to collect enough that do not
verge on buffoonery, or that have no element of vulgarity;
and indeed there is so much variation of tastes according
to the tone and training of the audience, that it is hardly
possible to tell what will be suited for hearers of each degree
of culture. Some delight in pathos or adventure, and
others will do nothing but laugh, and become noisy at anything
that is not highly comic. Such books for the purpose
as I have seen, between difficulty about copyright and desire
of novelty and drollery, do not avoid vulgarity. N.B.—It
is advisable to inspect thoroughly everything offered by
volunteers for reading, recitation, or singing.</p>

<p>It has, however, been thought better not to enter upon
the tracts and sermons, such as a parish priest or district
visitor would give for private use or specific purpose, as they
are devotional, and scarcely to be spread broad-cast by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Library. Every librarian must cater for his own clients
according to their tastes and needs. No doubt much is
here left out that will be found useful in some places, but
the attempt has been made to offer suggestions, and to
collect, from various quarters, names that may serve to assist
in the selection of books for the various needs of a parish.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LITTLE_ONES">LITTLE ONES.</h2>

</div>

<p>The books in the following list are what have been read to
children from five or six to eight years old and proved to be
interesting to them. Their eyes and attention soon show
whether the book is liked. And, though it may hardly be
believed, it is more difficult to write a story suited to them
than to any other class, since it must be perfectly easy and
simple, and yet have some interest in it, such as they can
understand. Stories that are in fact a study of children with
peculiar ways and odd sayings are of no use. The tale
must take the child’s point of view, yet without obviously
writing <i>down</i> to its level, and any moral must be pointed as
tersely and briefly as possible. Unluckily several of those
I have found most successful have gone out of print—namely,
‘The White Kitten,’ and ‘Out in the Dark,’ in early
packets of the books Mr. Burns used to publish, and
‘Little Lucy’ and ‘A Tale of a Tail’ (S.P.C.K.). I have
looked over multitudes of tiny books, but only a few have
the special charm that will keep a whole class devouring the
reader with their eyes, and be welcomed even if read over
and over again. I have not here mentioned Mrs. Ewing’s
beautiful series of verse-books for children, with their
charming illustrations, because they are really studies of
childhood, and more fit for the drawing-room than the
cottage or school. The same may be said of the very pretty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Everyday Fables, the letterpress of which is quite beyond
little children. The best thing for the youngest class of
four, five, or six years old, is the ‘Child’s own Picture
Paper’ (Dean), Aunt Louisa’s books (Warne), and the
‘Child’s Illustrated Scripture History’ (S.P.C.K.), 4 parts,
price 1<i>s.</i> each. Or, if the class be too large for showing
them pictures in a book, detached ones on an easel are
useful. One or two sacred ones, well explained, are enough,
and a few secular ones may follow. Let me hint that undraped
figures, shown to poor children, are undesirable, and
that if there is a mistake in the accessories, by some
fatality, they are sure to admire it. Cassell’s ‘Little Pet’s
Posy,’ 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, or ‘Little Chimes,’ 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, will give amusing
bits to read to the tiny children, but <i>lending</i> is of no use
unless they are ill. A complete set of pictures illustrating
the Gospels, or the lessons for nearly every Sunday in the
Christian year, can be arranged from the stores of the
S.P.C.K., the R.T.S., and Cassell’s ‘Child’s Bible and Life
of Christ,’ 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>For Children from Eight to Ten Years old.</i></p>

<p>The books here given are of a somewhat homely and
simple order, such as are understood and liked by children
without much cultivation or knowledge of the world—average
ones, in fact; for the intelligent and eager ones, or those
who have some home culture, need something of a higher
order.</p>

<p class="book" id="book20"><b>20. Louie White’s Hop-picking.</b> By <span class="smcap">Amabel Jenner</span>. (Griffith,

maiden, as inferior to her homely cousins in practical usefulness as she
is superior in knowledge.</p>

<p class="book" id="book21"><b>21. The Lion Battalion.</b> By <span class="smcap">Mary Hullah</span>. (Hatchards) 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Several short stories. The first is of a tiny German boy who makes
imaginary soldiers of buttons and abstracts a whole brilliant regiment
from his little friend’s jacket. It is less good than the second, ‘The
Fireman’s Little Maid,’ a friendship between a fireman and a little
neglected girl. Read aloud, it has charmed a third standard class and
a mothers’ meeting.</p>

<p class="book" id="book22"><b>22. Smuts and Diamonds.</b> By <span class="smcap">Selina Gaye</span>. (Remington) 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The first tale is on Christian brotherhood; the second, ‘Who did It?’
is of the mysterious painting of the effigy of a pig hung at the pork
butcher’s. It is my resource when I have to keep a mixed troop of
children quiet while waiting. The third, ‘Three Little Sisters,’ is a
warning to little nurses to be faithful.</p>

where the faithful little elder sister struggles to take care of the little

<p class="center"><i>For Children from Ten Years old to Twelve: Fourth
Standard and upwards.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Most children are advanced enough at this age to prefer
what is a little out of their own field; though here there
will always be the differing tastes for adventure or character,
and imaginative or matter-of-fact literature. What will fall
flat with some will be appreciated by others; and, in general,
what has been read to them is best liked. Explanations can
be given, right intonations are explanatory in themselves,
and foreign or unusual names are better understood.</p>

<p class="book" id="book64"><b>64. Under the Lilacs.</b> By <span class="smcap">Louisa Alcott</span>. (Sampson Low) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>A stray boy and poodle, escaped from a circus, arrive in the middle of
a doll’s feast held by a widow’s little girls. The house becomes their
home, and the scenes are delightful, especially when the poor dog is
lost and comes back <i>minus</i> his tail.</p>

<p class="book" id="book65"><b>65. On Angels’ Wings.</b> By the Hon. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Greene</span>. (Nelson) 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Pathetic and tender. A deformed and sickly child in a German
town has to part with her father on his summons to the war. Little
Violet’s patience, the drolleries of her little friends, the kindness of
the old policeman, and the thoughtlessness of her young nurse go to
children’s hearts.</p>

<p class="book" id="book66"><b>66. The Abbey by the Sea.</b> By Mrs. <span class="smcap">Molesworth</span>. (S.P.C.K.) 1<i>s.</i></p>

<p>A furniture designer of evidently much cultivation with his little
daughter by the sea-side. Perhaps too ideal, but refining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p class="book" id="book67"><b>67. The Golden Thread.</b> By Dr. <span class="smcap">Norman McLeod</span>. (Isbister)
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>This will also be found among the allegories, but it is, even as a
mere story or romance, so charming to young listeners that it is here
introduced.</p>

<p class="book" id="book68"><b>68. Feats on the Fiord.</b> By <span class="smcap">Harriet Martineau</span>. (Routledge)
1<i>s.</i> and 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (With 40 illustrations, 2<i>s.</i>)</p>

<p>Too lively and amusing to be out of date. Norwegian life is made
perhaps rather too rose-coloured, but the adventures have a merit and
interest apart from actual truth to nature.</p>

<p class="book" id="book69"><b>69. The Ghost of Greythorn Manor.</b> (Nelson) 6<i>s.</i></p>

<p>May be useful where children or servants fear a haunted house.</p>

<p class="book" id="book70"><b>70. Little Rosa.</b> By Mrs. <span class="smcap">Prentice</span>. (Nelson) 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="book" id="book72"><b>72. The Children on the Plains.</b> (Nelson) 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Adventures on the Prairies with Red Indians; a good deal of religious
talk.</p>

<p class="book" id="book73"><b>73. Daughter of the Regiment.</b> (Sunday School Union) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Children captured by Red Indians.</p>

<p class="book" id="book74"><b>74. Leila, or the Island.</b> By <span class="smcap">M. Fraser Tytler</span>. (Hatchards)
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Leila has always been an unfailing favourite. The second and third
parts of her story are unequal to the first volume, which is improbable
enough, but such pretty and pleasant reading, and so sound-hearted,
that it is quite a child’s classic.</p>

<p class="book" id="book75"><b>75. Mr. Burke’s Nieces.</b> (Cassell) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Confusion of identity between two children brought home from
India, one of whom the Irish barrister believes to be his niece. It
turns upon jealousy.</p>

<p class="book" id="book76"><b>76. Little Hinges.</b> (Cassell) 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>A child’s disobedience in apparently a small matter leads to great
family misfortunes. A sound lesson against ‘doing right in our own
eyes.’</p>

<p class="book" id="book77"><b>77. The Thorn Fortress.</b> By <span class="smcap">M. Bramston</span>. (S.P.C.K.) 1<i>s.</i></p>

<p>This will be classed among historical tales, as it belongs to the
period of the Thirty Years’ War, but the interest is sufficient to win
children quite ignorant of the history of the period. The inhabitants of
a village in the track of the armies have a refuge in the forest, impregnably
fenced with thorn bushes. The adventures of a little maiden,
who falls into the hands of the marauders, and wins their heart by her
innocent sweetness, are enjoyed by all readers and hearers.</p>

<p class="book" id="book78"><b>78. Max Krömer.</b> By <span class="smcap">Hesba Stretton</span>. (R.T.S.) 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="book" id="book79"><b>79. Lost in Egypt.</b> By Miss <span class="smcap">M. L. Whately</span>. (R.T.S.) 4<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The adventures of the little daughter of an English engineer, suddenly
left an orphan in a remote place, and abandoned by the servants.
She is adopted by a peasant woman, and afterwards has experience of
several Egyptian houses before she is recovered by her English grandmother.
Here and there it is lengthy, and some conversations might
be spared, but it has been listened to and read with great interest.</p>

<p class="book" id="book80"><b>80. The Blue Ribbons.</b> By <span class="smcap">Anna Harriet Drury</span>. (Kerby)
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Founded on the anecdote of Marie Antoinette acting fairy to the

&amp; Co.) 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>This is the best for reading aloud of the three historical tales by
these ladies. It begins with a child wedding in the days of Charles II.
The little bride (a Countess) is sent to school at Taunton, where the
mistress, a Huguenot, is enthusiastic in Monmouth’s cause, and the
poor girls are among ‘the maids of Taunton.’ The young husband
intercedes, but goes into banishment with the Jacobites, and his wife has
in after times to procure his pardon, after which they begin their married
life. The book has been found very attractive to children.</p>

<p class="book" id="book83"><b>83. The White Chapel.</b> By <span class="smcap">Esmé Stuart</span>. (S.P.C.K.) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>A dreamy child’s adventure, very prettily told, connecting the little
white curtained bed with the white chantry chapel in a cathedral.</p>

<p class="book" id="book84"><b>84. The Carved Cartoon.</b> By <span class="smcap">Austin Clare</span>. (S.P.C.K.) 4<i>s.</i></p>

<p>This has been much enjoyed when read aloud to somewhat intelligent
Sunday-school children in the country, and Londoners always like it.
The title is unfortunate, for a cartoon cannot be carved, and what is
meant is a copy of a cartoon made by Grinling Gibbons, whose adventures
in the Plague and Fire of London are made very interesting.</p>

<p class="book" id="book85"><b>85. Ivo and Verena.</b> (Masters) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>A beautiful little Fouqué-like tale of early Christianity in the North.</p>

<p class="book" id="book86"><b>86. Peggy and other Tales.</b> By <span class="smcap">Florence Montgomery</span>.
(Cassell) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>This may be useful where temperance tales are required, though we
rather wonder at the father who chose such a subject to amuse his
little children.</p>

<p class="book" id="book87"><b>87. The Ambition of Kate Hicks.</b> (S.P.C.K.) 4<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="book" id="book96"><b>96. Stories of Youth and Childhood.</b> (Walter Smith) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>These first appeared in the ‘Magazine for the Young,’ and are very
good. Phœbe, who is sent to the hospital, is our special favourite.</p>

<p class="book" id="book97"><b>97. Copsley Annals.</b> By Miss <span class="smcap">Elliot</span>. (Seeley) 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>These are unusually interesting. The supposed ghost, which turns
out to be a clock whirring, excites breathless interest. The last story
is better fitted for mothers than children.</p>

<p class="book" id="book98"><b>98. The House of the Little Wizard.</b> (Hatchards) 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="book" id="book99"><b>99. Goldhanger Woods.</b> By <span class="smcap">M. and C. Lee</span>. (National Society)
2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>This calls itself a child’s romance, and has some exciting adventures.</p>

<p class="book" id="book100"><b>100. My Great Aunt’s Cat.</b> (S.P.C.K.) 2<i>d.</i></p>

<p>A droll and wholesome warning against false excuses.</p>

<p class="book" id="book101"><b>101. Uncle Ivan.</b> By <span class="smcap">M. Bramston</span>. (National Society) 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Two sisters have to guard the papers of their uncle, a political exile,
against spies. Very amusing for rather advanced readers such as pupil
teachers.</p>

<p class="book" id="book102"><b>102. Wild Thyme.</b> (S.P.C.K.) 4<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="book" id="book103"><b>103. Susan Pascoe’s Temptation.</b> (S.P.C.K.) 4<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The first of these is very touching, the second its continuation and a

<p class="book" id="book108"><b>108. Nimpo’s Troubles.</b> (Griffith, Farran, &amp; Co.) 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>This is an American story of a self-willed child, which children like
very much. She chooses during her mother’s absence from home to
board with people of her own selection, and gets into very comical
predicaments.</p>

<p class="book" id="book109"><b>109. A Little Step-daughter.</b> By the Author of the ‘Atelier du

<p class="book" id="book111"><b>111. The Giant Killer.</b> By A.L.O.E. (Nelson) 3<i>s.</i></p>

<p>This is rather stilted, but has been much enjoyed by elder children.
It is much better than the second part ‘The Roby Family.’ As a rule,
this lady’s books are very religious, without Church teaching, and a
little too stiff in language, but useful.</p>

</div>

<p>Boys are here treated as separate subjects. The mild tales
that girls will read simply to pass away the time are ineffective
with them. Many will not read at all. Those who will
read require something either solid, droll, or exciting.
There are lads who will study books of real information
with all their might, and will take up pursuits of science, or
enter into poetry. This, however, comes (if at all) at the
age when school is over and labour has begun, so that
intellectual occupation is not the task but the refreshment.
The solid, therefore, is not attempted in the present list.
What it aims at giving is such a choice of books as boys
will listen to with interest, or if they read in quieter
moments, or in illness, may find so amusing as not to be
tempted to think that nothing diverting or stimulating is to
be found beyond the Penny Dreadful. If their taste can be
kept unsullied during the time of growth, there is more
hope for it afterwards.</p>

<p>The books here mentioned are all suitable for circulation
in any general library, but are placed separately as an
answer to the oft-asked question, ‘Do you know of anything
my boys <i>will</i> read?’</p>

<p>Many well-intentioned and really pretty books are
omitted, even though written <i>for</i> boys, because they do not
seem to hit off the peculiar taste of that large class. Others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
are omitted because, though there is little harm in them,
and we should not object to seeing a lad reading them, if of
his own catering, yet parish libraries and school rewards
give a kind of recommendation to a book which makes it
needful that it should be beyond censure. For instance,
that exciting and entrancing tale, ‘King Solomon’s Mines,’
is marred by the falsehoods told to the natives, and (more
injuriously perhaps) by the constant reference to bad
language on the part of the naval lieutenant, in a style to
confirm boys in their notion of its being a manly fashion.
Its successor, ‘The Phantom City,’ has none of these defects.
Be it remembered that this catalogue is only intended
to suggest and assist, not to exclude, and likewise that the
works therein are not merely suited to lads, for though girls
will often greatly prefer a book about the other sex, boys
almost universally disdain books about girls.</p>

alone.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that this book was written by the tutor of Baron
Humboldt and his brothers. It certainly encouraged a considerable
spirit of adventure, and perhaps was partly inspired by the pupils’
interest in it as it proceeded. The second edition here mentioned is
well illustrated, and is a fresh translation, more accurate perhaps, but
scarcely so inviting to the childish English reader as the first more
freely abridged version. The adventures are unfortunately more charming
than possible in either naval or scientific eyes.</p>

<p class="book" id="book118"><b>118. Masterman Ready.</b> By Captain <span class="smcap">Marryat</span>. (Warne) 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The outcome of a sailor’s disgust at the Swiss family’s raft of tubs

novelist, and exercising over the children the fascination of the two
preceding tales.</p>

<p class="book" id="book119"><b>119. The Island Queen.</b> By <span class="smcap">R. M. Ballantyne</span>. (Nisbet) 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Here a young lady is by general consent elected to be queen of a
shipwrecked crew. Mr. Ballantyne’s tales of adventure are perfectly
safe from the moral point of view, and always have a religious tone, but
when any matter brings forward points of difference, the tone is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
that of the Church. Happily, however, there is seldom room for any
such difficulty.</p>

<p>American, Fenimore Cooper-like adventures, but without the love

hero, a Christian, who appears in all difficulties. Boys revel in these
books, which seem to have an unusual attraction for them. The three
first form the ‘Boy Pioneer Series,’ the three last the ‘Log Cabin
Series.’ Many of the real pioneers of Kentucky are introduced.</p>

<p>The friendship that springs up between some German boys and their
French captives, well told.</p>

<p class="book" id="book132"><b>132. Treasure Island.</b> By <span class="smcap">R. L. Stevenson</span>. (Cassell) 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p>So exciting and engrossing that it must be mentioned, but bringing
the reader into rough company, among a good many horrors.</p>

<p class="book" id="book133"><b>133. Tom Brown’s School Days.</b> By <span class="smcap">T. Hughes</span>. (Macmillan)
2<i>s.</i> or 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The life is so fresh and wholesome in spirit that, though the sphere
is so different from that of the elementary school-boy, his tone may be
raised by it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p class="book" id="book134"><b>134. Ascott Hope’s Tales.</b></p>

<p>These are too numerous and have too many different publishers for
enumeration, but all are lively and wholesome tales of boyhood mostly
in school life, and are good to lend and give.</p>

1<i>s.</i> and 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (With 40 illustrations, 2<i>s.</i>)</p>

<p>Another public-school story, sound and spirited, and likely to
interest. People sometimes learn best from what does not profess to
be about their own life.</p>

<p class="book" id="book137"><b>137. In Quest of Gold on the Whanga Falls.</b> By <span class="smcap">C. H.
Johnstone</span>. (Cassell) 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Exciting Australian adventures. It is to be hoped they will not
inspire the gold fever, for which, however, ‘True Gold’ (see <a href="#book602">No. 602</a>)
may be an antidote.</p>

<p class="book" id="book138"><b>138. The Boy with an Idea.</b> By Mrs. <span class="smcap">Eiloart</span>. (Warne)
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>An inventive genius, always getting into exquisitely droll predicaments,
some of which are quite fit to do duty at a penny reading.</p>

<p class="book" id="book139"><b>139. Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea.</b> By <span class="smcap">Jules

1<i>s.</i> each.</p>

<p>Jules Verne is a modern Baron Munchausen with an air of science
and a Frenchman’s ironical gravity. To some he is perfectly enchanting,
but there are soberer minds who are bewildered as to whether the
wonders they read of are meant for truth or fiction, and dislike him
accordingly. We have only mentioned a small selection of his translated
works, but all are perfectly safe, for he is a religious, sound-hearted
man. ‘Dr. Ox’s Experiment’ is short enough for a penny reading
among intelligent people.</p>

<p class="book" id="book153"><b>153. Jackanapes.</b> By <span class="smcap">J. H. Ewing</span>. (S.P.C.K.) 1<i>s.</i></p>

<p>This beautiful story wins the attention of boys, but those who read

<p class="book" id="book157"><b>157. Tales by W. H. Kingston.</b></p>

<p>There are so many of these, and brought out by so many publishers
(S.P.C.K.), (Griffith, Farran, &amp; Co.), (Warne), (Shaw), (Nisbet), (Routledge),
that it is hardly possible to collect or enumerate them, and one
description answers for all. They are full of adventure, well studied
from travels and geography, perfectly safe and innocent, with more
incident than character, and very useful for those who love adventurous
tales.</p>

<p class="book" id="book158"><b>158. Tales by R. M. Ballantyne.</b></p>

<p>These also are too numerous for individual mention. They teach much
as to manners, geography, &amp;c., and there is a conscientious, religious
tone about both authors, but Mr. Ballantyne’s are apt to be rather confused
where any Church matter comes in question.</p>

</div>

<p>The stories under this head are chosen for their unusual
excellence, but they deal in general with a way of life, with
pursuits, allusions, and temptations, so much out of the line
of the ordinary clients of the parish library that we do not
recommend them for that purpose, although they would do
no harm but decidedly good, so far as they were understood,
and, where readers of a superior degree are included, would
be excellent.</p>

(Marcus Ward) 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>A lively, clever set of children, slightly over-independent of their
parents. They get into a scrape by secretiveness about their pleasures,
and their discussions of their clergyman might not be edifying to some
readers.</p>

<p class="book" id="book177"><b>177. Hermy, the Story of a Little Girl.</b> By Mrs. <span class="smcap">Molesworth</span>.

<p>One Rose is a professor’s daughter, the other is a carpenter’s. They
come into connection at the soup kitchen of a Sisterhood, much to
their mutual benefit. The trials of the professor’s daughter are those
of a large intellectual family in a London house, where inclination often
has to be silently sacrificed.</p>

<p class="book" id="book185"><b>185. Decima’s Promise.</b> By <span class="smcap">Agnes Giberne</span>. (Nisbet) 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>This is made to a servant girl not to reveal an accident to a young
child of which both alike are guilty. It results in the poor child’s
idiocy, and thus would be a wholesome warning to nurses, but Decima’s
other troubles are rather out of their beat.</p>

<p class="book" id="book201"><b>201. Boys and Girls.</b> (S.P.C.K.) 1<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The best thing in these is a remarkable fable or allegory, quite fit to
be read separately, where each person is represented as chained for
life to some animal symbolising character, and the question in each
case is, Will the animal subdue the human being to the ruin of both, or
will the human creature make the animal his obedient servant to the
salvation of both?</p>

<p>This is delightfully illustrated and is a charming story, but it has the
fault—a serious one if reverence is desired—of giving holy Names
misspelt for baby utterance. A touch of the pen will alter this.</p>

<p>These exquisite pieces of Mrs. Ewing’s are too delicately worked for
the ordinary style of children or the poor, though they may be appreciated
by those who have time to dream over them and, as it were,
imbibe them.</p>

<p>The lessons are given by a lady to a class of boys, each of whom has
his own history and character, and, besides pursuing this, stories are
told and read to them. It is a very useful book for teaching from,
making the class in hand answer the questions and look out the references
(of which there is a very large choice); and the stories, which are
not quite equal to the teachings, can be read or not according to time
and expediency.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BOOKS_BEARING_ON_HOLY_SCRIPTURE">BOOKS BEARING ON HOLY SCRIPTURE.</h2>

</div>

<p>These are needed for various classes of readers. The
highest and best are those who need to study the Scriptures
devotionally. Works for these hardly come within the
scope of a parish library—nor do the Commentaries, such
as the Speaker’s or the Cottage Commentary of the S.P.C.K.,
although in an ideal school these ought always to be accessible
by the teachers. What is here to be provided is a set
of books that will illustrate the intellectual side of the Bible,
and may in the first place instruct the teachers, and in the
next make it plain to the young minds that there is infinite
interest in the study of Holy Scripture even after they have
left school, a fact which they are too slow to believe.
Conversations can be read with drawing-room classes or
Bible classes with advantage, leaving the pupils to look out
references and make observations. There are innumerable
varieties of Bible stories, but there is no use in mentioning
these. It is much better to teach the narrative of the
Patriarchs direct from the Book itself, reading it to the
children till they can read with perfect ease, and then reading
<i>with</i> them. Later, Dr. Maclear’s two ‘Class Books of
the Old and New Testaments,’ 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (Macmillan),
are useful in disentangling the narrative and explaining
the chronology; and for those who find a difficulty in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
selecting passages, and passing over those chapters, verses,
or phrases to which it is not well to direct children’s attention,
C. M. Yonge’s ‘Scripture Readings’ (Macmillan) may
be an assistance, as they are chronologically arranged, and
harmonised with portions of the Prophetical writings. Five
series, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each, without comment; 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> with comment.</p>

<p>The books that follow begin with the easiest, and fittest
to lend to a thoughtful child, especially to a little invalid.</p>

<p class="book" id="book281"><b>281. Parables of Our Lord.</b> By the late Earl of <span class="smcap">Derby</span>.
(S.P.C.K.) 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>These American books are admirable in their way, bringing in
Eastern research, historical inquiry, and lights from science in a conversational,
but always reverent manner. They do not go into the
types or spiritual lessons, but are thoroughly sound and excellent for
reading with fairly intelligent young people. I used ‘The Kingdom
of Judah’ with great success with a pupil-teacher.</p>

</div>

<p>Too many allegories are not desirable, nor should they even
be pressed upon those who do not accept them readily. To
the imaginative, who are perhaps two-thirds of the people
we deal with, they are an excellent and persuasive mode of
teaching and influencing. The remaining third at first take
them for fact, as people did in mediæval times by the stories
of St. Christopher or St. Margaret, and when the delusion is
dispelled feel resentment, as if deceived; or else they look
on the allegory either as a tale meant to cheat them into
being instructed or as an irreverent riddle. Any way, when
forced on them, it gives a sense of unreality which is, above
all, what they dislike, and which may damage even their
feeling for the truths thus represented.</p>

<p>Too many allegories, even for the most receptive readers,
are undesirable, and among those here mentioned, it may be
wiser to make a choice.</p>

<p class="book" id="book335"><b>335. The Pilgrim’s Progress.</b> By <span class="smcap">John Bunyan</span>. (Macmillan)

1<i>s.</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, 2<i>s.</i>, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>In spite of all its peculiarities, the king of allegories must be
admitted. It is not likely that Bunyan’s doctrines will do any harm,
though for these purposes we do regret that Dr. Neale’s edition,
arranged for Church people, is out of print.</p>

<p class="book" id="book358"><b>358. Sintram and his Companions.</b> By <span class="smcap">La Motte Fouqué</span>.</p>

<p>This most striking of allegorical tales cannot be omitted, when it is

that they actually named places in Ratcliffe Highway and London
Docks from ‘The Castle of the Moon,’ ‘Rocks,’ &amp;c. There was a

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HISTORICAL_TALES">HISTORICAL TALES.</h2>

</div>

<p>These are of considerable value, not only as serving as
‘sugared history’ and conveying facts, but sometimes as
supplying the element of romance which is almost essential
to a wholesome development. Moreover, these stories are
of great assistance in making it evident that the actors in
history are not mere names with dates attached, to load the
memory for an examination, but that they have been flesh
and blood beings like ourselves.</p>

<p>There has been of late a great attempt to supply these
tales, with very varied success. Some are so interesting as
to be read apart from all purpose, for their mere interest.
Others present nothing but wooden puppets put into the
carefully studied costume of their period, and stiffly working
out the facts, with much pains but no life. These, however,
have a certain value, not only because perverse youth
will read them when it will not read real history; but also
because when a special period has to be ‘got up,’ they
impress details of manners, dress, and habits in a convenient
way. We shall therefore endeavour to give a chronological
list of English, foreign, and Church history tales.</p>

<h3><i>TALES ON EARLY CHURCH HISTORY.</i></h3>

<p>There are many of these, and it is difficult to choose
among them. Those are here mentioned which may serve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
best to interest young people in the primitive Church, and
give some idea of the days of martyrdom.</p>

<p class="book" id="book361"><b>361. Triumphs of the Cross, and Deeds of Faith.</b> By Rev.
<span class="smcap">J. M. Neale</span>. (Masters) Two series, each 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p class="book" id="book363"><b>363. Followers of the Lord.</b> By Rev. <span class="smcap">J. M. Neale</span>. (Masters) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Brief tales through the whole range of Church history, some of them
quite unrivalled in effectiveness.</p>

<p class="book" id="book364"><b>364. Helena’s Household.</b> By the author of ‘The Schönberg-Cotta
Family.’ (Nelson) 4<i>s.</i></p>

<p>This tells of the days of the Catacombs.</p>

<p class="book" id="book365"><b>365. Gaudentius.</b> By the Rev. <span class="smcap">G. F. Davies</span>. (S.P.C.K.) 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="book" id="book366"><b>366. Lapsed not Lost.</b> By the Author of ‘The Schönberg-Cotta

<p class="book" id="book367"><b>367. The Egyptian Wanderers.</b> By Rev. <span class="smcap">J. M. Neale</span>. (Masters)
2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Giving with much vividness the trials of the Christians at different
times of persecution.</p>

<p class="book" id="book368"><b>368. Narcissus.</b> By the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Ripon</span>. (S.P.C.K.) 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="book" id="book369"><b>369. Conquering and to Conquer.</b> (S.P.C.K.) 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The days of St. Jerome and the Gothic invasion of Rome.</p>

<p class="book" id="book370"><b>370. Bilihild.</b> By <span class="smcap">Julie Sutter</span>. (R.T.S.) 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="book" id="book371"><b>371. Mitslav, or the Conversion of Pomerania.</b> (S.P.C.K.)

<p class="book" id="book372"><b>372. Tales illustrating Church History.</b> (Parker, Oxford) In
seven 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> vols., to be had separately.</p>

<p>I regret that these tales are not to be had singly as before, and that
they are arranged by countries, not chronology. The most useful for
illustrations of primitive Church history are those called ‘Asia and
Africa’ and ‘France and Spain,’ containing the four following:—</p>

<p class="book" id="book373"><b>373. The Quay of the Dioscuri.</b></p>

<p>On the persecution of St. Athanasius.</p>

<p class="book" id="book374"><b>374. The Exiles of the Cevenna.</b></p>

<p class="book" id="book377"><b>377. The Farm of Aptonga.</b> (Masters) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>African adventures of Christians.</p>

<h3><i>TALES ON ENGLISH HISTORY.</i></h3>

<p>These tales of English History are given in greater
numbers and with less sifting than the others, because when
a particular period is proposed for study or examination a
story even of no great merit may be an assistance. Also
some belonging to higher literature are enumerated so as to
make out a complete list.</p>

<p class="book" id="book378"><b>378. The Camp on the Severn.</b> By Rev. <span class="smcap">E. Cutts.</span>
(Mowbray) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p class="book" id="book379"><b>379. No. XIII. The Lost Vestal.</b> By <span class="smcap">Emma Marshall</span>.
(Cassell) 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Both these start from St. Alban’s martyrdom. Neither is quite
satisfactory as to correctness, but the second is the more vivid, the
latter part being upon scenes at Rome. The first needs less education
to be understood.</p>

<p class="book" id="book380"><b>380. Stories of the Days of King Arthur.</b> By <span class="smcap">C. H. Hanson</span>.
(Nelson) 3<i>s.</i> and 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Hardly to be called historical, but with the grand outlines of Sir T.
Malory’s great romance and with excellent illustrations by Gustave
Doré. Desirable as giving the genuine English heroic tale, noble in
itself, and furnishing allusions. It is intended to prepare the way for
Malory and Tennyson, and there is thus little said of the Quest of the
Holy Grail.</p>

<p class="book" id="book381"><b>381. Edwy the Fair.</b> By Rev. <span class="smcap">A. D. Crake</span>. (Rivingtons) 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="book" id="book382"><b>382. Alfgar the Dane.</b> By Rev. <span class="smcap">A. D. Crake</span>. (Rivingtons) 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="book" id="book383"><b>383. The Rival Heirs.</b> By Rev. <span class="smcap">A. D. Crake</span>. (Rivingtons) 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>This and the other ‘Chronicles of Æscendune’ endeavour to dramatise
the days of Anglo-Saxon history. Young people like them very
much, but there is more of adventure and research than of character or
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p class="book" id="book384"><b>384. The Champion of Odin.</b> By <span class="smcap">Hodgetts</span>. (Cassell) 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p>A fierce story of wild Northmen invading England. The manners
are well touched, but there is the great error of making Alfred knowingly
re-baptise a Dane who had recurred to his wild life.</p>

<p class="book" id="book385"><b>385. Harold.</b> By Lord <span class="smcap">Lytton</span>. (Routledge) 6<i>d.</i>, 2<i>s.</i>, and 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>This and other historical novels of high merit are here mentioned to
complete the series, though only for advanced readers.</p>

<p class="book" id="book386"><b>386. The Camp of Refuge.</b> (Leach) 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The legend of Hereward le Wake, not told with the fire of imagination
which Kingsley has thrown into it.</p>

<p class="book" id="book387"><b>387. Hereward, the Last of the English.</b> By <span class="smcap">C. Kingsley</span>.
(Macmillan) 6<i>s.</i></p>

<p>But we should prefer the former of the two for younger and simpler
readers.</p>

<p class="book" id="book388"><b>388. Lady Sybil’s Choice.</b> By <span class="smcap">Emily S. Holt</span>. (Shaw) 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Miss Holt’s tales will be enumerated in their order of chronology, but
the following description must be understood to apply to all. Manners
and customs, history and chronicle, are minutely studied; but the mediæval
Church is never understood, and sympathy is uniformly with those
who separated from it. What is especially to be regretted is that there
are often innuendoes and even more direct attacks on present practices
and opinions, which the author thinks a return to what she reprobates.</p>

<p class="book" id="book389"><b>389. The Knight’s Ransom.</b> By Mrs. <span class="smcap">Valentine</span>. (Warne)

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MYTHOLOGY">MYTHOLOGY.</h2>

</div>

<p>If we wish the young generation to understand more about
allusions than is conveyed in the foot-notes of their School
Readers, we must let them have access to a few books containing
the more remarkable myths. I do not recommend
Sir George Cox’s, as the reducing them to the supposed
Aryan origin of natural phenomena mars the pleasure of
reading them. The best books are:</p>

<p class="book" id="book510"><b>510. The Heroes.</b> By <span class="smcap">C. Kingsley</span>. (Macmillan) 6<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The earlier myths are here told to perfection. The only pity is that
there are not more of them.</p>

<p class="book" id="book511"><b>511. Tanglewood Tales: and the Wonder Book.</b> By <span class="smcap">N.
Hawthorne</span>. (Routledge) 2 vols. 2<i>s.</i> each, or 1 vol. 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Several of these are on the same subjects as those of Kingsley, but
told with less deference to the original outline. Prometheus and Midas
are specially memorable for the <i>point</i> given them. I have seen Midas
delight clever village children and utterly perplex dull ones.</p>

<p class="book" id="book512"><b>512. Stories from Heathen Mythology.</b> By Rev. <span class="smcap">J. M. Neale</span>.
(Masters) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Simply and charmingly told.</p>

<p class="book" id="book513"><b>513. Greek Hero Stories.</b> By <span class="smcap">Niebuhr</span>. (Shaw) 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>These are translated from the German in which Niebuhr told them
to his little son.</p>

<p class="book" id="book514"><b>514. The Heroes of Asgard.</b> By A. and <span class="smcap">E. Keary</span>. (Macmillan)
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>To add the myths of our own ancestors to those of Greece, we have
here the stories of Odin and Thor beautifully told.</p>

<p><i>Professor Church’s series, published by Seeley, should be in school libraries
of a higher class, but they are too numerous and too expensive for
the ordinary parish library.</i>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p class="book" id="book515"><b>515. Cruise of Ulysses and his Men.</b> (Griffith, Farran, &amp; Co.)
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="book" id="book516"><b>516. Old Greek Stories.</b> By <span class="smcap">Charles Henry Hanson</span>. (Nelson)
3<i>s.</i> and 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="book" id="book517"><b>517. Wanderings of Æneas.</b> By <span class="smcap">Charles Henry Hanson</span>.
(Nelson) 3<i>s.</i> and 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Narratives well told and illustrated. In the ‘Æneid’ it is often almost
translation. Outline illustrations in Flaxman’s style, often from the
antique, very small, but as nude figures occur, they must be shown with
caution. Excellent prizes for boys aiming at cultivation of mind.</p>

<p>For want of a better title, we give this to tales fit for the
growing maidens who are beyond the child story, and, above
all, need to have their ideal of love and courtship elevated
and refined. A few actual novels are added, in case it is
thought desirable to put them into a library where the
readers are of a somewhat superior class, as where there are
the older girls and young women who will read what is
mischievous if the good is not supplied.</p>

<p class="book" id="book518"><b>518. Christopher.</b> By <span class="smcap">Helen Shipton</span>. (S.P.C.K.) 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>A very beautiful imitation of the legend of St. Christopher carried
into modern life.</p>

<p class="book" id="book519"><b>519. The Valley Mill.</b> (S.P.C.K.) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Farm life, where the obstacles in the course of true love are the cattle
plague and a strange robbery of an old miser. The young heiress,
popularly called ‘the little Squire,’ is a charming portrait.</p>

<p class="book" id="book520"><b>520. From Over the Water.</b> (Walter Smith) 6<i>s.</i></p>

<p>A Scotch bailiff meeting with strong insular prejudice in the Isle of
Wight.</p>

<p class="book" id="book521"><b>521. Rufus.</b> (Masters) 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>This is by the same author and in the same locality, but the hero
in this case is a native fisherman, the heroine a somewhat spoilt Scottish
lassie, sister to the gardener and the pet of the young ladies.</p>

<p class="book" id="book522"><b>522. The Lutaniste of St. Jacobi’s.</b> By <span class="smcap">C. Drew</span>. (Marcus
Ward) 6<i>s.</i></p>

<p>A German tale of music and lace-making, with an excellent moral

<p>This is the odd name of an old sailor on board a hulk who adopts a
little orphan. There is a small novel of higher life connected with it,
very prettily carried out.</p>

3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The governess is a very pretty character. We could dispense with
her becoming a marchioness in her own right, but no doubt it renders
her the greater favourite.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FAIRY_TALES">FAIRY TALES.</h2>

</div>

<p>There are certain fairy tales that are absolute classics, and
a knowledge of which is absolutely necessary to understand
common allusions. The grandmothers have ceased to tell
them, and the little chap-books are no more, so that it has
happened to me to pause on a mention of ‘Cinderella’ or
‘Beauty and the Beast,’ and find no one understand it, and I
have kept a whole school interested while waiting for an
entertainment by telling one of these. Therefore, a <i>small</i>
list is here given, for fairy tales should be regarded as
treats, and only the superior ones put forth freely. It will
generally be found that in the first stage of education they
are despised, but that children of any imagination enjoy
them. One or two <i>imaginative</i> classics are added.</p>

<p class="book" id="book576"><b>576. The Fairy Book.</b> Selected by the Author of ‘John Halifax.’
(Macmillan) 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>These are the genuine old fairy tales, that ought to be known to
everyone, simply told.</p>

<p class="book" id="book577"><b>577. Grimm’s Fairy Tales.</b> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paull’s</span> Selection. (Warne)
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Globe edition (Macmillan) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>These two sets make up the real folk-lore tales—remnants of old
myths, of more modern ones.</p>

<p class="book" id="book578"><b>578. Hans Christian Andersen’s Fairy Tales.</b> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paull’s</span>
Selection. (Warne) 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>These have, by their merits, become almost as classical as their
predecessors, and quite as proverbial. The ‘Ugly Duckling’ and the
‘Daisy’ ought to be known to all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p class="book" id="book579"><b>579. The Hope of the Katzekopfs.</b> By the Rev. <span class="smcap">F. Paget</span>.
(Masters) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Deserves to be classical for its fun and its moral.</p>

<p class="book" id="book580"><b>580. Old-fashioned Fairy Tales.</b> By Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ewing</span>. (S.P.C.K.)
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Modern, but according to the ancient rules of fairy tales.</p>

<p class="book" id="book581"><b>581. The Arabian Nights.</b> By the Rev. <span class="smcap">G. F. Townsend</span>.
(Routledge) 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>These are almost necessary for the understanding of allusions, besides
the fascination of such tales as ‘Aladdin’s Lamp,’ ‘The Forty Thieves,’
or ‘Sindbad.’ It is remarkable that Hannah More thought even the
old uncastigated tradition translated from the French more wholesome
reading for young people than contemporary tales of character, perhaps
because less tending to introspection.</p>

<p class="book" id="book582"><b>582. Alice in Wonderland.</b> By <span class="smcap">Lewis Carroll</span>. (Macmillan)
6<i>s.</i></p>

<p class="book" id="book583"><b>583. Through the Looking-Glass.</b> By <span class="smcap">Lewis Carroll</span>.
(Macmillan) 6<i>s.</i></p>

<p>It takes some cultivation to enjoy these wondrously droll compositions.</p>

<p class="book" id="book584"><b>584. The Water Babies.</b> By <span class="smcap">C. Kingsley</span>. (Macmillan) 6<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The same may be said of this. These are literature, though we are
not sure whether ordinary school children would care for them.</p>

<p class="book" id="book585"><b>585. Fairy Legends of the South of Ireland.</b> By <span class="smcap">Croker</span>.
(Swan Sonnenschein) 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p>These are some of the most delightful fairy tales in existence, told
with an Irish humour that adds infinitely to their zest.</p>

<p class="book" id="book586"><b>586. The Light Princess.</b> By <span class="smcap">G. Macdonald</span>. (Daldy) 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Worthy to be old fairy tales.</p>

<p class="book" id="book587"><b>587. The Little Lame Prince.</b> By the Author of ‘John
Halifax.’ (Macmillan) 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Too beautiful and earnest not to be well worth reading.</p>

<p class="book" id="book588"><b>588. Four Winds Farm.</b> By Mrs. <span class="smcap">Molesworth</span>. (Macmillan)</p>

<p>One of the best of Mrs. Molesworth’s dream-like tales.</p>

<p class="book" id="book589"><b>589. Down the Snow Stairs.</b> By <span class="smcap">Alice Corkran</span>. (Blackie) 6<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Of the same type.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MOTHERS_MEETINGS">MOTHERS’ MEETINGS.</h2>

</div>

<p>Weary, hardworked women thoroughly enjoy a bit of interesting
reading, whether pathetic or droll. Foreign tales or
those of adventure do not, as a rule, interest them, and the
old-fashioned book, where a preternaturally wise dame
instructs her neighbours is too much a lecture in disguise.
By all means, let there be some religious reading, then if
possible some on sanitary habits, domestic economy and
management of children, but not under the disguise of a
story. A good, genuine fiction gives them a real interest
and something to talk of. It should not appear to be a
child’s book or they will feel insulted, but they like nothing
better than when the joys or sorrows turn on an infant; and
there is no better mode of conveying indirect lessons—to
some persons, that is to say, for there are others who have
no notion of applying what they hear to real life. Still,
wholesome amusement is a thing of which they get all too
little, and the pleasure of being read to is one they
thoroughly appreciate. Of course these books are specially
fitted for lending to old or young. They are only classed under
the category of books for Mothers’ Meetings because eminently
fitted for that purpose as well as for Lending Library
shelves.</p>

2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The bequest is a delicate child, left by a dying mother to a kindly
little formal dressmaker while the father is at sea. The complications
on his return are most effective. When he makes a blundering offer
and gets refused, a listening woman has been known to rap the table
in an ecstasy of enjoyment.</p>

<p class="book" id="book598"><b>598. Tales for Mission Rooms.</b> (S.P.C.K.) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The first of these is a capital lesson on gossip; the second has a very
touching portrait in it.</p>

<p class="book" id="book599"><b>599. Meg’s Mistake.</b> By Mrs. <span class="smcap">O’Reilly</span>. (Strahan)</p>

<p>Originally published as ‘Sussex Stories.’ Very lifelike, and two
at least can be read with admirable effect—namely, ‘Fairy Gold’ and
another bringing in the accident to the London steamboat ‘Princess
Alice.’ The others have been tried, but do not seem as well liked.
Perhaps they are too wordy.</p>

she thinks is a skeleton warning in her eye, also a deserted wife and

are quaint.</p>

faithful uprightness and industry are the saving of all.</p>

<p>The beginning, being an old fisherman’s difficulties with a baby

<h3><i>COUNSEL.</i></h3>

<p>When the clergyman will open mothers’ meetings, and
give a little instruction, this is all that is requisite to convey
the religious tone. If he be not there, it may be well to begin
with something serious. Some ladies can explain a chapter
of the Bible, but in most cases a reading will be most
convenient for the purpose. Here are a few suggested:—</p>

<p class="book" id="book634"><b>634. Letters from an Unknown Friend.</b> By the Author of
‘Charles Lowder.’ (Kegan Paul) 1<i>s.</i> (See <a href="#book280">No. 280</a>.)</p>

<p>Short explanations of the claims of the Church, which may be useful
as guarding against Dissent.</p>

<p class="book" id="book635"><b>635. An Address to Women.</b> By the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Carlisle</span>.
(S.P.C.K.) 2<i>d.</i></p>

<p>This is a most admirable, practical address given at the time of the
Carlisle Church Congress. It goes into the ordinary trials of woman’s
life with great force, and at the same time gives all encouragement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p class="book" id="book636"><b>636. An Earnest Appeal to Mothers.</b> By Mrs. <span class="smcap">G. Sumner</span>.
(Nisbet) 3<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Strong and touching appeals to mothers on guarding the purity of
their children from the first.</p>

<p class="book" id="book637"><b>637. A Few Words to Mothers of Little Children.</b> (Hatchards)
2<i>d.</i> each or 50 at half-price.</p>

<p>Teaching the same lesson of preserving modesty. These three little
books may be given broadcast, but they will be more effective if first
read.</p>

<p class="book" id="book638"><b>638. Half-hours at Mothers’ Meetings.</b> 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Some of the little discourses here are very useful. One entitled
‘The Hour of Temper’ merits especial praise.</p>

<p class="book" id="book639"><b>639. The Chimney Corner.</b> By <span class="smcap">E. Wordsworth</span>. (Hatchards)
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="book" id="book640"><b>640. Short Words for Long Evenings.</b> By <span class="smcap">E. Wordsworth</span>.
(Hatchards) 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="book" id="book641"><b>641. Work-a-Day World.</b> By <span class="smcap">E. Wordsworth</span>. (Hatchards)
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>All the above three are deeply thoughtful, often poetical, yet simple
moralisings on common things.</p>

<p class="book" id="book642"><b>642. Plain Words.</b> By the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Bedford</span>. One series 2<i>s.</i>,
or in separate tracts in 3 packets, 1<i>s.</i> each.</p>

<p>The force and beauty of these need no praise here, and they have
the further merit of being just the right length.</p>

<p class="book" id="book643"><b>643. The Scripture Half-hour at Mothers’ Meetings.</b>
(R.T.S.) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>There are some admirable bits here, especially in the way of true
anecdote and application, but some selection may be needful.</p>

<p class="book" id="book644"><b>644. Bits of Talk on Home Matters.</b> (Sampson Low) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>There are most admirable chapters in this little book; to be valued
by mothers of all degrees. ‘A polite mother’ is an admirable lesson.</p>

<p>The above are serious. Those that follow are domestic
and secular.</p>

<p class="book" id="book645"><b>645. Ways and Means in a Devonshire Village.</b> (S.P.C.K.)
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Conversations on household management and cookery, done with
spirit, and eliciting remarks and comparisons.</p>

<p class="book" id="book646"><b>646. Lectures on Health.</b> By Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hallett</span>. (Hatchards)

<p class="book" id="book648"><b>648. Till the Doctor Comes.</b> By Dr. <span class="smcap">Hope</span>. (R.T.S.) 6<i>d.</i>, in

<p class="book" id="book649"><b>649. The Making of the Home.</b> By Mrs. <span class="smcap">C. Barnett</span>.
(Cassell) 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Very good hints on house, health, and clothes.</p>

<p class="book" id="book650"><b>650. Social Economy Reading Book.</b> (National Society) 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Even better adapted for reading <i>to</i> mothers than by children.</p>

<h3><i>EXTRACTS.</i></h3>

<p>A few passages are here mentioned as serving well to read
aloud at Mothers’ Meetings, though the whole book might
not serve equally well.</p>

<p class="book" id="book651"><b>651. The Way of the Cross.</b> By <span class="smcap">Emily S. Holt</span>. (Shaw)
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The ‘Web Ismene Wove,’ the third tale in this book, is exceedingly
beautiful, and is an excellent reading near Passiontide. It is the story
of a Greek girl at Jerusalem, who longs to make something to be used
in the service of the God of Israel. The white web she weaves comes
to be sold in haste to Joseph of Arimathæa, and thus her longing is
fulfilled. The second tale is harmless, being of the mother of Ahaz,
and how she spoilt her son; but the first would hardly be given or read
aloud by those who would shrink from the strong assertion that SS.
James, Jude, and Joses were sons of the Blessed Virgin.</p>

<p class="book" id="book652"><b>652. The Man on the Top of the Ark, and other Gospel
Parables.</b> By <span class="smcap">Alexander MacLeod Symington</span>. (Nisbet) 1<i>s.</i></p>

<p>If at the end of the first parable the reader inserts the text, ‘The
like figure whereunto even Baptism doth now save us,’ the teaching is
complete. The application of the Brazen Serpent and the City of
Refuge is also excellent. They are the Biblical history dramatised, as
it were. (See <a href="#book353">No. 353</a>.)</p>

<p class="book" id="book653"><b>653. Catharine and Crawfurd Tait.</b> (Macmillan) 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 6<i>s.</i></p>

<p>If the reader can command her voice to get through it, the history
of Mrs. Tait’s successive bereavements will be listened to with intense
interest.</p>

<p class="book" id="book654"><b>654. Mrs. Gaskell’s Tales.</b> In 7 vols. (Smith, Elder, &amp; Co.)
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each.</p>

<p class="book" id="book655"><b>655. Libbie Marsh’s Three Eras.</b></p>

<p>St. Valentine’s day. Story of a factory girl and a cripple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p class="book" id="book656"><b>656. The Sexton’s Story.</b></p>

<p>An heroic act of self-sacrifice.</p>

<p class="book" id="book657"><b>657. Christmas Storms and Sunshine.</b></p>

<p>A quarrel made up over a baby.</p>

<p>These are of such very different composition that all that
can be done here is to suggest books bearing on varieties of

either cultivated ladies, middle-class women, or very young
people.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IMPROVING_BOOKS">IMPROVING BOOKS.</h2>

</div>

<p>Under this head are classed those on different countries, on
history, biography, natural history, popular science, and real
adventure.</p>

<p>As has been said before, these are specially suited for
prizes, as they will be read again in after life. For those
intended for young people there will never be any great
demand. In almost all lending libraries they stand still on
their shelves with clean pages. We teach our children too
much for them to be willing to learn for themselves. The
appetite may come in after times, and sometimes may exist
or be excited in some particular direction. In cases where
young people are secluded from school by illness, it is desirable
on all accounts that their mental fare should include
something besides devotional books and fiction.</p>

<p>To begin with, the use of maps and the reading lessons
at school make scenes in different countries interesting, and
perhaps the surest books to be appreciated as rewards are
those giving pictures of costumes, &amp;c.</p>

<h3><i>ON DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.</i></h3>

<p class="book" id="book702"><b>702. The Children of Africa.</b> (Hodder &amp; Stoughton) 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Fully illustrated, very easy and amusing, though China is better
done than Africa as being a less wide field.</p>

<p class="book" id="book703"><b>703. Early English Voyagers.</b> (Nelson) 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The voyages of Drake, Cavendish, and Dampier excellently told.</p>

<p>These are not so ornamental as Cassell’s series, though they have
maps and illustrations; but if I may judge from the two specimens I
have seen—namely, ‘France’ and ‘Germany’—they are full of interest
and information amusingly given, and would be excellent for any intelligent
person in need of knowledge of some special place. Very
good for town or club libraries where the readers rise above fiction.</p>

each.</p>

<p>An excellent abstract of the American Arctic expeditions of the ‘George
Henry,’ the ‘Polaris,’ and the ‘Jeannette.’</p>

<h3><i>ADVENTURES.</i></h3>

<p>These are truthful adventures, in contradistinction to
the Kingston, Ballantyne, Verne, and other ‘books for boys’
which abound. Where we should <i>lend</i> those we should <i>give</i>
these.</p>

</div>

<p>History is seldom very acceptable to young people of the
working classes. They do not live in a sufficiently cultivated
atmosphere to keep up interest in what they learn at school;
but sometimes an event or perhaps an historical tale rouses
their curiosity, and those a little more cultivated ought to learn
to read for themselves. Histories are particularly desirable
as prizes, since they may be used and referred to through
life. Moreover, everything should be done to get pupil-teachers
beyond the mere cram of names and dates.</p>

absolutely religious biography.</p>

<p>It is not easy to choose among the many lives of the
Queen that the Jubilee has brought forth. S.P.C.K. and
R.T.S. have each a large handsome one and a penny one.
‘<i>The First Lady in the Land</i>’ (Wells Gardner, Darton,
&amp; Co.) is cheap and attractive. Tulloch’s ‘<i>Life of Queen
Victoria</i>’ (Nisbet) for boys and girls, and Miss Yonge’s
‘<i>Victorian Half Century</i>’ (Macmillan), 1<i>s.</i> or 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, have
both had the honour of Her Majesty’s correction, and are
both for the young; Tulloch’s, perhaps, for the youngest.
Another life of Queen Victoria (Nelson), 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, is a marvel
of cheapness and very prettily told.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="NATURAL_HISTORY">NATURAL HISTORY.</h2>

</div>

<p>I have not found natural history popular in libraries.
Indeed, I have known a magazine given up because there
was too much of it. The children have a large amount of
it in their Readers at school, where they like it, as it is a
less dry subject than is presented by many of their lessons. If
they belong to the Band of Mercy they sometimes have to
get up the subject, and there is no doubt that this conduces
to the cure of wanton cruelty. But though, as an alternative
to a real study, children will enjoy an anecdote, and though a
master, mistress, or friend can lead them to use their eyes
and assist in some pursuit or collection, it is only the
exceptional ones with a developed taste who will voluntarily
read more than an occasional story. Where there is a real
taste in one direction, technical books can be supplied, but
the aim of the lending library can only be to give out works
of general information or interest, such as may lead to a love
of nature, prevent wanton or careless barbarity, and possibly
excite a wholesome taste in some special direction. The
S.P.C.K. has excellent technical and popular manuals, but
these are fit for those who wish to <i>study</i> their subject, and
should be possessed, not borrowed.</p>

<p>For lending may be suggested:—</p>

<p class="book" id="book820"><b>820. Population of an Old Pear Tree.</b> From the French of <span class="smcap">Van
Bruyssell</span>. (Macmillan) 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Capitally illustrated, and full of loveliness of description of the insect
inhabitants of the tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p class="book" id="book821"><b>821. Chapters on Popular Natural History.</b> By Sir <span class="smcap">J. Lubbock</span>.
(National Society) 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Though published as a reading book, this is better for lending.</p>

<p class="book" id="book822"><b>822. Outdoor Common Birds.</b> Eighty illustrations. (Warne)
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Even country children need this. They observe birds very little,
and hardly know the names of any; even local provincial names are
few, and they need to learn not to regard birds as enemies to be robbed
and slaughtered.</p>

<p class="book" id="book823"><b>823. Our Dogs.</b> By Mrs. <span class="smcap">Beecher Stowe</span>. (Nelson) 1<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Real dogs—very good for readings and prizes for a Band of Mercy.</p>

<p class="book" id="book825"><b>825. With the Birds.</b> By <span class="smcap">Mary Howitt</span>. (Nelson) 1<i>s.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="RELIGIOUS_BOOKS">RELIGIOUS BOOKS.</h2>

</div>

<p>Very few directly religious books are here suggested. It is
not well to give a very serious book in a chance way to a
young creature expecting amusement. And the best books
are fit rather to make a lengthened stay with the reader than
to be handed on in the library. Tracts for special purposes
do not belong to the general class of books in circulation,
and those here set down are chiefly such as give information
on principles, rather than actually devotional books or
sermons.</p>

<p class="book" id="book857"><b>857. Plain Words.</b> By the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Bedford</span>. (Wells Gardner

<p class="book" id="book861"><b>861. Holy Living and Dying.</b> By Bishop <span class="smcap">Jeremy Taylor</span>.
(Rivingtons) 1<i>s.</i> each.</p>

<p>Still as true as ever.</p>

<p>It is very desirable to get good magazines taken in by the
parishioners. They are the most effectual means of occupying
the ground against hurtful publications, and serial stories
running on keep up the interest. If a shopkeeper can be
made an agent, with a small percentage, the affair will
thrive, as children’s magazines may be subscribed for at
school.</p>

<p class="book" id="book870"><b>870. Little One’s Own Picture Paper.</b> (Dean) 1<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The pictures are wonderfully good, so are the verses. Capital for
showing to the infant class at a Sunday school.</p>

<p class="book" id="book871"><b>871. The Rosebud.</b> (Clarke &amp; Co.) 1<i>d.</i></p>

<p>For very small children.</p>

<p class="book" id="book872"><b>872. The Children’s Pictorial.</b> (S.P.C.K.) 2<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Full of chromolithographs; but the stories are not serial, and this
<i>some</i> children do not like.</p>

<p class="book" id="book873"><b>873. The Prize.</b> (Wells Gardner, Darton, &amp; Co.) 1<i>d.</i></p>

<p>This bears a highly coloured ‘picture,’ and is greatly liked.</p>

<p class="book" id="book874"><b>874. The Child’s Companion.</b> (R.T.S.) 1<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Well illustrated, and with pretty stories and short religious lessons.</p>

<p class="book" id="book875"><b>875. Chatterbox.</b> (Wells Gardner, Darton, &amp; Co.) Weekly, ½<i>d.</i>
Monthly, 3<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Well illustrated and amusing; fit for young people somewhat older.
The information is capital.</p>

<p class="book" id="book876"><b>876. Little Folks.</b> (Cassell) 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>A somewhat superior article, with sensible tales, original correspondence,
and prize competitions. Matter fairly good.</p>

<p class="book" id="book877"><b>877. My Sunday Friend.</b> (Mowbray) 1<i>d.</i></p>

<p>With the strongest Church tone of all these, and useful Sunday
questions. Stories good.</p>

<p class="book" id="book878"><b>878. Sunshine.</b> 1<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Fairly good; but the Bible questions are too like riddles.</p>

<p class="book" id="book879"><b>879. Boy’s Own Paper.</b> (R.T.S.) 1<i>d.</i> weekly, 6<i>d.</i> monthly.</p>

<p>Capital, and full of adventurous tales.</p>

<p class="book" id="book880"><b>880. Girl’s Own Paper.</b> (R.T.S.) 1<i>d.</i> weekly, 6<i>d.</i> monthly.</p>

<p>Hardly equal to the Boy’s, but very much appreciated by girls in
their teens, whose wants it seems to satisfy in a sensible, innocent way.</p>

<p class="book" id="book881"><b>881. Dawn of Day.</b> (S.P.C.K.) ½<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Fit for older children and young people. Can be localised.</p>

<p class="book" id="book882"><b>882. Atalanta.</b> (Hatchards) 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Especially for young girls, and proposing very useful subjects for competition.</p>

<p class="book" id="book883"><b>883. Penny Post.</b> (Parker) 1<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The eldest of all these, and still keeping up its reputation.</p>

<p class="book" id="book884"><b>884. The Youth’s Companion.</b></p>

<p>An American weekly published by Perry, 41 Temple Place, Boston.
A subscription of 10<i>s.</i> per annum would bring it to England, and it has
some of the best reading for young folks that we know.</p>

<p class="book" id="book885"><b>885. Parish Magazine.</b> (Wells Gardner, Darton, &amp; Co.) 1<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The first of all to be localised. Always fairly good.</p>

volume.</p>

<p>With a strong Church tone. Very spirited. Can be localised.</p>

containing articles on Holy Scripture.</p>

<p class="book" id="book890"><b>890. Cassell’s Family Magazine.</b> Monthly, 7<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Of a more secular but wholesome character, with tales and substantial
information.</p>

<p class="book" id="book891"><b>891. Good Words.</b> (Isbister) 6<i>d.</i></p>

religious article or two—‘unsectarian.’</p>

<p class="book" id="book892"><b>892. The Net.</b> (Bemrose &amp; Sons) 1<i>d.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The foremost counsel to be given to those commencing
Penny Readings is to beware of exciting an expectation
that all readings and recitations shall be comic. It is
probable that a considerable proportion of the audience will
enjoy what is adventurous or pathetic; but if the lads,
whose prime object is to make a noise, once get into the
habit of expecting that everything shall be the occasion of
laughing, they will consider themselves defrauded by anything
else, and spoil all chance of listening. Even if they come
in a civilised mood, a little excitement will set them off, and
make them unmanageable all the rest of the time, and habits
will set in which will drive the readers at last into mere
buffoonery. Drollery is quite expedient, but it should be
only just at the end, as a <i>bonne bouche</i>, when the uproariousness
which it creates can speedily be worked off out of
doors, or else a race of young tyrants will be raised up who
will effectually prevent taste from being raised among the
audience.</p>

<h3><i>POETRY FOR READING OR RECITATION.</i></h3>

<p>Poetry answers better than prose if <span class="smcap">well</span> recited or read,
and a child is generally rapturously listened to if it can do
the thing with spirit and not like a lesson.</p>

<p class="hanging">By Sir <span class="smcap">John Lubbock</span>, Bart., M.P., F.R.S., Author of “Ants, Bees,
and Wasps,” &amp;c. With 90 Illustrations. Pp. 224. Bevelled boards,
cloth gilt, price 2<i>s.</i></p>

<p class="smaller">“These selections from Sir John Lubbock’s well-known works have been judiciously
chosen, and the illustrations are admirable. Altogether, it is the most attractive of
countless reading-books that the New Code has called forth.”—<span class="smcap">Journal of Education.</span></p>

<p class="smaller">“It has been admirably condensed from his larger works on insects and wild flowers,
and will excite the wonder of young readers by the insight it gives them into the
mysteries of nature and science.... There is abundance to charm all classes of students,
and to set them thinking.”—<span class="smcap">Daily Chronicle.</span></p>

<p class="smaller">“A more interesting and instructive book we have not read for some time.... The
chapters on the colours of animals, and on plants, fruits, and seeds, should be read by
every person who has acquired the art of reading.”—<span class="smcap">Irish Teachers’ Journal.</span></p>

Bevelled boards, cloth gilt, pp. 662, price 4<i>s.</i></p>

<p class="smaller">“Miss Yonge’s two small volumes are suited to children by their simplicity of
language and clearness of subject.... We think that the poems are judiciously and
carefully chosen, and much attention has been bestowed on the short notes, the chief
object of which is just to give children a little knowledge of matters and allusions which
they would not properly understand.”—<span class="smcap">Educational Times</span> on Parts I. and II.</p>

<p class="smaller">“We have no doubt that it was a labour of love to Miss Yonge to select and to
annotate the stirring ballad music in which English literature is so rich. It will be
nothing less than a liberal education to the children of the poor (or, indeed, of the rich)
to commit to memory and ponder over such verses as these.”—<span class="smcap">Literary Churchman.</span></p>

<p class="smaller">“We have in this interesting volume a rare collection of pieces suitable for recitation.
Much judgment has been exercised in choosing suitable poems, and care has been taken
in so adapting the pieces for standard work that their fitness is at once apparent. It is
the best collection of historical ballads that we know of.”—<span class="smcap">Teachers’ Aid.</span></p>

<p class="center larger">THE LIFE OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR
JESUS CHRIST</p>

<p class="center"><i>Illustrated from the Italian Painters of the Fourteenth, Fifteenth,
and Sixteenth Centuries.</i></p>

<p class="center">A Preface has been furnished to this volume, on the Growth of Religious
Art in Italy, by Mr. <span class="smcap">F. T. Palgrave</span>, who has also added Critical and
Explanatory Notes on the Pictures and their Painters.</p>

<p class="center">Richly bound in cloth boards, bevelled, gilt edges, price 21<i>s.</i></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="hanging smaller">The <b>Church Quarterly Review</b> says:—“This book is a perfect gem.... It is,
indeed, a relief to turn to such matchless designs as these. It would be impossible
to speak too highly of the knowledge of the history of art, the elevation of
thought, and the elegance of style which Mr. Palgrave displays.”</p>

<p class="hanging smaller">The <b>Spectator</b> says:—“The drawings are executed with much skill; and the
chromo-lithographic process is here employed with delicacy and success. Mr.
Palgrave’s notes are pertinent and instructive. His Introduction is able and
eloquent.”</p>

<p class="hanging smaller">The <b>Academy</b> says:—“This is a very beautiful book, and the chromo-lithographs
with which it is adorned, or rather, which are illustrated by the text, reflect
great credit on the care and skill of all concerned in their production.”</p>

<p class="hanging smaller">The <b>Athenæum</b> says:—“By way of preface, a highly intelligent and critical essay
on the growth, aims, and developments of religious art in Italy by Mr. F. T.
Palgrave. Each well-weighed and thoughtful sentence is worth reading. The
general purport of the book is well represented by the title. Mr. Palgrave
vouches for the beauty of the drawings made by Mr. Goodall, from which the
chromo-lithographs were taken.... A very ambitious effort has been extremely
successful.”</p>

<p class="hanging smaller">The <b>Portfolio</b> says:—“The eloquent and informing preface and the critical notes
on the pictures, by Mr. F. T. Palgrave, are addressed to an adult and cultured
audience.... The literary part of the volume deserves more careful consideration
than is usually accorded to letterpress penned to accompany even high-class
illustrations.”</p>

<p class="hanging smaller">The <b>Art Journal</b> says:—“A work which should be the most popular, as it must be
the handsomest, of Christmas books bearing a religious character.... Twenty-four
wonderful little chromo-lithographs from drawings made on the spot....
